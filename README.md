# Interactive Machine Learning Traiining with Streamlit

This applicaiton is my first attemp to use streamlite to deploy an interactive machine learnign app. The main purpose is to work with a simple dataset and study the performance of the different ML algorithms 

This app is design to:
- Create an interact interface for hyperparamater tunning
- Compare model performance using most common performance metrics.

## How To Use ?

- In the sidebar the model for binary classification
- Selec the value for the hyperparameter for the model selected
- Choose metric for plotting
- Click Classify buttom
