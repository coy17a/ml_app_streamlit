## Model Comparison for a Bynary Classification APP
This is a simple application that allows to compare performance of three diferente machine leanring algorithms.

The app was created using streamlit wich allows user intereactivity. In the app the hypermarameters of the model can be modifiy to study the effect in the performance of the model in the test data.
